Task: Maintenance Interval Calculator

Imagine we are working with an up-and-coming Mercedes-Benz dealership known for excellent service and cutting-edge technology. Through our product, "Serviceflow," we have digitalized the dealership's aftersales process, and as the final milestone, the workshop scheduling system is being digitalized.

Now, it's your turn! To optimize the dealership's workflow, our development team has the idea to create a console application in Python to plan and manage appointments efficiently. This application should help the dealership team maintain an overview of their calendar and provide smooth service for their customers.

Your task is to develop a simple yet powerful solution that includes the following functions:

Collect Vehicle Data:

Prompt the user for the vehicle make, model, year, and current mileage.
Define Maintenance Intervals:

Create a dictionary with predefined maintenance intervals for various vehicle types.
Example: {"VW Golf": {"Oil Change": 15_000, "Inspection": 30_000}}
Calculate Next Maintenance:

Based on the vehicle data and mileage, determine when the next maintenance is due.
Consider various maintenance types (e.g., oil change, inspection, brake fluid).
Display Results:

Show the user a clear list of upcoming maintenance tasks.
Display the remaining mileage until the next maintenance is due.
Additional Requirements:

Implement basic error handling for user inputs.
Comment on your code.
If possible, test your code.
Structure your code into functions.


Bonus (if you have extra time):

Allow users to input custom maintenance intervals for non-predefined vehicle models.
